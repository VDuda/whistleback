# WhistleBack MVP - LegalHack 2025 Submission

[![IMAGE PLACEHOLDER - Banner Image Here - 1200x630]]

## 🎯 Project Overview

**WhistleBack** is a decentralized bounty marketplace that transforms IRS whistleblowing from a dangerous, solo endeavor into a collaborative, incentivized, and anonymous collective effort.

**Live Demo:** https://whistleback.vercel.app

**Demo Video:** https://youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID

## 🔥 Problem Statement

Current IRS whistleblowing forces individuals to:
- **Work alone** with limited resources and perspective
- **Face retaliation risk** without adequate anonymity protections
- **Build incomplete cases** due to isolated evidence gathering
- **Miss out on rewards** while lawyers collect most of the bounty

This leads to underreporting of tax fraud and fewer successful cases.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

WhistleBack enables **anonymous collaboration** by allowing multiple contributors to:

1. **Pool Evidence** - Submit encrypted "shards" of evidence to themed pools
2. **Build Strength** - Aggregate contributions until reaching lawyer auction threshold
3. **Trigger Auctions** - Automatically match with vetted tax lawyers
4. **Distribute Rewards** - Smart contracts ensure fair reward sharing via Story Protocol tokens
